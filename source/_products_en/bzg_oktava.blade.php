    <h3 class="major">Description</h3>
    <p>The frequency synthesizer provides the formation of an equidistant frequency grid
      in steps of 3.5 MHz at three outputs in accordance with the information
      coming into it from the computer.</p>

    <p>The synthesizer is made on a modern element base in a hybrid-integrated version,
      equipped with an integrated monitoring system with a fault signal in TTL levels.</p>

    <p>The module has high stability and reliability over a wide range of temperatures,
      is resistant to a wide range of mechanical and climatic factors.</p>
